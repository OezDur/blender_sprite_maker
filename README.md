# Isometric Sprite Generator for Blender

To install:
- Run install.bat as administrator or open powershell and run `Install-Module powershell-yaml`
- Find your blender python dir (under the blender directory)
- From a command line run `/path/to/blender/python.exe -m ensurepip`
- Then run `/path/to/blender/python.exe -m pip install pyyaml Pillow`
- Edit the config.yml file to point to the blender executable for blender_path
- Edit the config.yml file to point to the desired blend file

To run: `blender -b /path/to/blend_file.blend -P prite_script_blender.py` OR the batch file `run.ps1` for the lazy

As an example I have set up the following Blend file with an animated model with 8 orthographic cameras looking at the model from 45 degrees up and 45 degree increments in a full circle around the model.
